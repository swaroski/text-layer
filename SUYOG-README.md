# Text-to-SQL LLM Integration

This update introduces an integrated Text-to-SQL tool powered by GPT-4o, capable of translating natural language questions into SQL, executing them on DuckDB, and summarizing the result in plain English.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary of Changes

###  Core Processor Integration

I updated the `ProcessChatMessageCommand` to support:

- Tool calling via `text_to_sql` function
- Schema introspection and sampling
- SQL generation and execution via LLM
- A second round of LLM-based "judging" to improve summary clarity

The tool now supports complete natural-language-to-result functionality directly in `/v1/threads/chat`.

### üì¶ New Route (for Streamlit Testing)

I also created a separate callable function `text_to_sql(question: str)`:
- Designed to be easily invoked from Streamlit or CLI.
- Lets you test isolated logic (schema retrieval, SQL generation, result summarization).

Run it via:

```bash
doppler run -c dev -- python -m streamlit run streamlit_chatbot.py
```

You can interact with the chatbot in the Streamlit UI .
